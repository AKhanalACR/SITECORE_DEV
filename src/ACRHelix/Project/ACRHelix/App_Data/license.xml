      <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt" lang="EN-US">: Licensee will be provided a License Key that gives Licensee access to the Sitecore Software. The Sitecore Software may be used only on the equipment with the features and limitations specified in the License Key. The License Key shall be time-limited until full payment of the license fee has been received by Licensor. The License Key may limit the number of installations of the Sitecore Software and the capacity of the Servers on which the Sitecore Software may be installed. For purposes of this Agreement, one Server is defined as a physical or virtual Server with a processing power for the web process equivalent to at most eight CPU cores. For example, one physical Server may contain eight single-core CPUs, four dual-core CPUs, two quad-core CPUs or one eight-core CPU. A Server with three or four quad-core CPUs would therefore count as two Servers.</span>

Licensee will subsequently be charged an annual fee of 20% of the retail price of all software purchased (the “Maintenance Program Charge”). Three years after the date of the initial purchase and each three-year anniversary thereafter, Licensor may adjust the Maintenance Program Charge then in effect for all software purchased under this Agreement to 20% of the Licensor’s then-current retail prices. Licensee may cancel the Maintenance Program by providing Licensor with 60 days notice prior to the end of any 12-month Maintenance Program period.  Licensor may cancel the Maintenance Program upon Licensee’s failure to pay timely any applicable Maintenance Program charge. A cancelled Maintenance Program may not be renewed except upon payment of double the amount of fees that would have been paid during the lapsed period. <o:p></o:p></span>

      </b>
      <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt" lang="EN-US">: “Patch” as used in this Agreement means a specific, targeted fix to a discrete problem in the use or functionality of the Sitecore Software that Licensor in its sole discretion defines to constitute a “Patch” and may from time to time provide to Licensee. “Upgrade” as used in this Agreement means a new version of some or all of the Sitecore Software, or an improvement in the use or functionality of the Sitecore Software more substantial than a Patch, that Licensor in its sole discretion defines to constitute an “Upgrade” and may from time to time provide to Licensees enrolled in the Sitecore Maintenance program. Licensee expressly acknowledges that Upgrades and Patches may change functionality of the Sitecore Software and integration with other systems, and may not work with some or all of the Sitecore Software modules, or be backward compatible with earlier versions of Sitecore Software. Installation of Patches and Upgrades is the choice and responsibility of Licensee. To the extent that operation of the Sitecore Software is affected by problems in standard software, including, but not limited to, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Windows and the Microsoft.Net Framework, then Licensee shall install updates to such standard software per Licensor’s specifications in order to resolve these issues. Licensor has no control over such standard software, and cannot assure that problems with such standard software will be corrected, or that such corrections will be made in a timely manner. <o:p></o:p></span>
